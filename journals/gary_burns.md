## A-ha Moment

# Journal Entry - [3/1/23]

## Today's Progress

- Worked on the layout and plans for the websocket data structuring, deciding to use message 'types' for payloads within our WS.
- Mocked up our HTML pages for use as a baseline for our Tailwind implementation.

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.
- Also, justify-content and align-items are way different.

# Journal Entry - [3/4/23]

## Today's Progress

- Finalized implementing the react components for the main chat to match our HTML mockup.
- Began work on refactoring the back-end for message handling and clarifying terminology.

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.
- Also, I really enjoy allegorizing concepts into real world counterparts, such as the connectionmanager function working as a 'router' for websocket 'messages'(which we're changing to packets).

# Journal Entry - [3/5/23]

## Today's Progress

- Rewrote our websocket queries to better understand the flow.
- Began organizing our packet system for messages.

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.
- Also, nomenclature matters. Using packet at the name made things much much clearer to understand.

# Journal Entry - [3/6/23]

## Today's Progress

- Websocket rewrites complete.
- Began looking into Redux implementation, but decided to shelf it and get a working React model up first.

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.
- Also, nomenclature matters. Using packet at the name made things much much clearer to understand.

# Journal Entry - [3/7/23]

## Today's Progress

# Journal Entry - [3/11/23]

## Today's Progress

- Attempted to reconfigure functions to retrieve username of logged in user

# Journal Entry - [3/12/23]

## Today's Progress

- Managed to get front-end to work with back-end information, and got a working model of MVP going

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.
- Also, redux does make managing states earlier, once you get it set up.

# Journal Entry - [3/18/23]

## Today's Progress

- Did some front-end cleanup, coded a function to randomly color the background of each user icon based on their username.

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.
- Using the module operator with 256 confines random outputs to a RGB-eligible number.

# Journal Entry - [3/19/23]

## Today's Progress

- Crafted unit tests, made them all work, did some more styling work, and crafted a plan for the rest of the week.

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.
- Unit tests are fickle, complicated, especially when you involve authenticators.

# Journal Entry - [3/20/23]

## Today's Progress

- Worked on the readme, did some readme styling, and focused on front-end presentation.

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.

## A-ha Moment

- Realized that I do not enjoy journaling.
- Proprietary software defintiely comes with its hangups.
